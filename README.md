## What is SEI?

**Sxnnyside Eloquent Icons (SEI)** is a carefully designed SVG icon system built as part of the **Sxnnyside Project ecosystem**.

SEI is not a massive icon catalog. It is a **curated system** where every icon exists because it was needed in a real interface.

The goal is simple:

* Clear visual language
* Strict consistency
* No platform bias
* Long-term maintainability

If an icon does not communicate clearly, it does not belong here.

---

## Philosophy

SEI follows a small set of non-negotiable principles:

* Icons are created **on demand**, not in bulk
* Consistency matters more than quantity
* One concept equals one icon
* Visual rules are enforced, not suggested

You can read the full vision here:

* [Manifesto](docs/manifesto.md)
* [Visual Rules](docs/rules.md)

This repository contains the **complete and up-to-date icon set**.

See the full list of available icons here:
[Icon List](docs/icon-list.md)

---

## Open Source

SEI is **free and open-source**.

You are welcome to:

* Use it in personal or commercial projects
* Adapt it to different platforms
* Propose new icons when a real use case exists

Contributions are evaluated based on **coherence and necessity**, not volume.

---

## Platform Agnostic by Design

SEI icons are provided as **clean SVGs**, making them usable across:

* Flutter
* SwiftUI
* Jetpack Compose
* React / Web
* Desktop applications

Framework-specific adapters may exist, but the icon system itself remains neutral.

## Why SEI Exists

Most icon libraries optimize for scale.
SEI optimizes for **identity and clarity**.

It exists to support products that care about visual language, not just visual assets.

---

## Sxnnyside Project

SEI is part of the broader **Sxnnyside Project**, an independent ecosystem focused on building tools, applications, and creative systems with strong identity and long-term vision.
