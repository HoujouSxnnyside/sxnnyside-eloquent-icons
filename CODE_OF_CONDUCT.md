# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

Sxnnyside Eloquent Icons (SEI) exists to be a calm, focused, and intentional creative space. This Code of Conduct is not about control — it is about protecting the quality of collaboration, discussion, and contribution around the project.

We value clarity over noise, intent over ego, and respect over volume.

---

## Our Standards

We expect everyone interacting with this project (issues, discussions, pull requests, or external references) to:

* Be respectful, concise, and constructive.
* Assume good intent, but communicate clearly.
* Focus on the work, not the person.
* Accept feedback without defensiveness.
* Offer critique that is actionable and relevant.

Good contributions are:

* Thoughtful
* On-topic
* Aligned with SEI’s vision and rules

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated:

* Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks of any kind.
* Aggressive, dismissive, or condescending communication.
* Spam, self-promotion, or irrelevant marketing.
* Low-effort issues or pull requests that ignore existing documentation.
* Attempts to derail discussions or push agendas unrelated to SEI.

If your interaction adds noise instead of value, it does not belong here.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

* GitHub issues and pull requests
* Discussions and comments
* Any official SEI communication spaces

It does not attempt to govern external communities, forks, or private use of the icons.

---

## Enforcement

Maintainers of SEI reserve the right to:

* Remove comments or contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.
* Close issues or pull requests without further explanation.
* Temporarily or permanently restrict participation.

Decisions are made to protect the project, not to debate behavior.

---

## Reporting

If you encounter behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please:

* Avoid escalating publicly.
* Contact the maintainers through a private channel or GitHub discussion.

All reports will be reviewed thoughtfully and discreetly.

---

## Final Note

SEI is open-source, but it is not uncurated.

Participation is welcome.
Alignment is required.

If this environment does not feel comfortable to you, that is okay — not every project needs to fit everyone.
