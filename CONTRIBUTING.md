# Contributing to Sxnnyside Eloquent Icons (SEI)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Sxnnyside Eloquent Icons (SEI)**.

This document explains how to contribute without friction.

## Before You Contribute

Please read the following documents first:

* `README.md`
* `MANIFESTO.md`
* `RULES.md`
* `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

If your idea conflicts with any of these, it is unlikely to be accepted.

## What You Can Contribute

### Icon Requests

If you need an icon that does not exist:

* Open an **Issue** labeled as `icon-request`.
* Clearly describe:

  * The concept and meaning of the icon.
  * The intended use case.
  * Whether it should be outline, filled, or both.

Requests that are vague, duplicated, or out of scope may be closed.

---

### Icon Contributions

You may submit new icons if:

* They follow all visual rules defined in `RULES.md`.
* They are provided as clean, optimized **SVG files**.
* They match the SEI style and naming conventions.

Each icon should:

* Be intentional and reusable.
* Avoid unnecessary detail.
* Feel consistent with the existing set.

Pull requests with bulk icons, autogenerated assets, or inconsistent styles will not be accepted.

---

### Improvements & Fixes

You may also contribute:

* Visual refinements to existing icons.
* Documentation improvements.
* Tooling or workflow suggestions.

Keep changes focused and justified.

---

## What Is Not Accepted

* Auto-generated icons without human design intent.
* Icons copied or heavily inspired from other icon libraries.
* Large unsolicited icon packs.
* Style experiments that deviate from SEI’s identity.
* Contributions made without reading the rules.

---

## Contribution Process

1. Open an issue describing your idea or request.
2. Wait for confirmation or discussion.
3. Submit a focused pull request.
4. Be open to feedback and iteration.

Maintainers may request changes or close pull requests that do not align with the project.

## Final Notes

SEI grows intentionally, not aggressively.

Quality matters more than quantity.
Consistency matters more than speed.

If your contribution respects that, it is welcome.
